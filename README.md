This is a nice little Minecraft resource pack for the most recent version (as of the upload of pre-1.0 RC1, 1.21.5) to add some mice little tweaks of my own to the game.
This pack is still very unfinished, so be sure to help out by submitting an issue. (Can you tell that I am very inexperienced with GitHub?)
You can find the changelog within the .zip download. It contains the changelog of all previous versions, too, so there is no need to download any previous versions if you want to look at past changes.
If you don't like anything in the pack, just get rid of it! That's what this is all about; I made this to show what resource changes I like to see in the game, but my taste isn't shared with everyone.
